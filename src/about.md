According to Chambers 20th Century Dictionary (my favorite, by the way) "disquisition" means "a careful enquiry into any matter by arguments, etc: an essay".  I expect it's not a word you've come across, though I'm sure you're familiar with its opposite "inquisition".  Interesting that "inquisition" is so much more common but perhaps that's because it often has a negative if not infamous connotation, as in 'The Spanish Inquisition'.  I'd like to think "disquisition" is the quieter, always helpful but unsung alternative.  Enlightening and exploring through thoughtful enquiry.

By extension a "disquisitioner" is someone who crafts such careful enquiries -- an explainer, if you will.  I've always felt a connection to that concept and therefore to the term.  I love learning new things, seeing how things work, and sharing what I've come to undertsand with others. Hence disquisitioner.com.

I’m an electrical engineer both genetically and by training, and have spent over forty years designing, developing, marketing, selling, and using computers and software. I’ve worked as an individual researcher and developer, managed small exploratory teams, and led full product engineering organizations of over two hundred people. My career path has given me a chance to build tiny embedded devices, mobile and consumer electronics, operating systems and middleware, core web plaform technologies, telecommunications and information systems, and components of large data centers.

This site is where I can share my adventures, experiments, and accumulated knowledge. What you'll find here is organized around three categories -- brief blog-style posts that capture the ebb and flow of what I'm up to, applications built as web pages and/or with web technologies, and longer form articles with more detail on projects, places or experiences.  

The site itself is built from [Hylia](https://hylia.website), a lightweight [Eleventy](https://11ty.io) starter kit with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) pre-configured, making it easy to one-click install a progressive, accessible website or blog in minutes.  Learning how to have and maintain a presence on the web is one of those things I became curious about, endeavored to learn, and therefore to share.
