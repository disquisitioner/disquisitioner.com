Here you will find a top-level listing of all pages in the site of type 'Page', which means content that aren't posts.  These will be more enduring things that aren't part of the accumulated timeline that posts represent.  Good examples of pages would be longer form articles I write, or web applications I build and deploy here, or step-by-step guides to doing things I've figured out how to do.
