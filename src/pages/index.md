title: Some Pages!

Iâ€™m hoping this will show up as a top-level page in the /pages directory, which I could use to build an access point to get to however many pages I built beneath this point. Otherwise they all end up in their own subfolder but there's no way to easily get to it.

I might even be able to auto-generate a list of pages if I can establish an index.html in the top-level pages folder.
