Elsewhere here you'll find posts, which are blog-style dated entries that most often reflect something happening at that particular moment.  This is a page, which is a more enduring bit of content apart from the post-oriented timeline.

By default Hylia supports both pages and posts, it just doesn't happen to include any sample pages.
This is an attempt to address that.
